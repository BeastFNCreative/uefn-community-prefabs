# How To Use

- Click on the name of the prefab you want to copy.
- On the top right, click Copy Raw File, next to the download button.
- In UEFN, press CTRL + V to paste!*
            **It is recommended to disable Fortnite Cell Snap when pasting in prefabs, otherwise*
            *some assets might be in the wrong position!*     

# Download Guide

- Download the provided files for the Prefab / Gallery you want.
- Locate your UEFN Project locally, then unzip the file wherever you want in your Project. 

**(WARNING: Please don't do it infront of the "Plugin" folder, it should be after "Content")**
- In UEFN, right click on the newly created folder and hit "Resave All"

Assets are now ready to use, if you also wanna use the Prefab provided:

- Open the downloaded text file.
- Replace all instances of whatever is listed as the Project Name on the download page with the path you placed it at. (CRTL + H)

*To minimize the chances of messing up, replace the slashes aswell so you replace with /MyProjectName/, instead of MyProjectName.*

Example:
```
Old Path: /Main/Apollo/CliffHouse_C/BuildingActors/WoodHouse_SolidWall_TwoSideTrim
New Path /YourProjectName/AnyPotentialSubfolders/ZIPName/Apollo/CliffHouse_C/BuildingActors/WoodHouse_SolidWall_TwoSideTrim
```
*Make sure you only replace the project name with your new path as otherwise, references might be disconnected.*

Now if you paste the text again, you should have the full prefab, if this didn't work contact me on Discord: @emily_999
